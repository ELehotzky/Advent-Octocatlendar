This app is an open-source, beginner-friendly project that is welcoming new pull requests!

*Maintainers*
-------------
This app was created by Erica Lehotzky (@ELehotzky), Kelly Lwakatare (@kells08), and Eddie Childress (@no-relation) as part of MLH's Local Hack Day (Houston Hack Day) 2018. 

*Dependencies*
--------------
Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Octocat images pulled from https://octodex.github.com/ - artist credits in image tags.

*Challenges we ran into*
------------------------
Merge conflicts!

*What we learned*
-----------------
A lot of refresher on vanilla JavaScript and CSS. We're also looking forward to learning what it's like to maintain an open-source repo!

*What's next for Advent Octocatlendar*
--------------------------------------
That's up to you! Fork and clone the repo, get creative, have fun, and open a pull request! Or check out our wish list below for ideas.

*Wish List*
-----------
-Refactor! This code was put together in about 9 hours, so it's not necessarily the prettiest! Practice the Single Responsibility Principle (https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/solid-part-1-the-single-responsibility-principle--net-36074) and break out some of our functions!
-Add more functionality! Maybe we could use a border of twinkling Christmas lights, animation on the card flips, or sound effects/jazzy holiday tunes.
